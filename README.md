# Mini Project 2: #2 Oracle for Shor's Algorithm

Gabriella Torres Nothaft

Here is my oracle for Shor's algorithm. It is set up in a way where it should work for any arbitrary N. The notebook includes the base code for the oracle, a command to print out the circuit, information on gate complexity, and a working demo for N=15.
